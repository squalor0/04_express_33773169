  <h1>About This Project</h1>

  <p>This website was created as part of my Dynamic Web Applications labwork at Goldsmiths 
    University.</p>
  <p>It uses <strong>Node.js</strong> and the <strong>Express</strong> framework to 
    demonstrate server-side concepts such as routing, and dynamic content generation.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is <strong>Blake Murphy</strong>. I enjoy working with backend technologies, 
    exploring how servers handle requests, and learning to build efficient web applications.</p>
