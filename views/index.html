  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This site was built using <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express</strong> as part 
    of a web development lab exercise.</p>
  <p>It demonstrates basic routing, and serving HTML pages through an Express 
    router.</p>
  <p>I can't think of anything else to put here but I am just adding text to make it seem less
    empty.</p>
